# Client

The client configuration is using the socket.io library to communicate with the socket.io on the nodeserver.
The Front-End is a react app.

## Making a new build

In case you modify anything from the existing client src files, run `yarn build` or `npm build` to remake the build and see your changes.

The files that are being sent by the server are in `client/public/build`.
